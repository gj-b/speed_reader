Why: The human brain is better able to focus when it stares at one place. Speed reading takes advantage of that by fixing the placement of the outputted words.


Implementation
	1. Read in pages of text file. 
	2. Split curr_page into x number of curr_sentence
	
Wrap-in keyboard / button shortcuts: 
	1. Read in pages of text file. 
	2. Split curr_page into sentences. 
	3. Split curr_sentence into x_word lengths.
	4. Print curr_string. 
	5. Time fuction pause here in order to control the speed of output. 
	EOL.

GUI: Has way to import file through button clicks. But can also import file through terminal when run the program. 
Outputs the words onto the screen. 
Buttons to speed up / slow down / pause (also shows keyboard shortcuts).

Can:
Import a text file. 
Change the speed of text output. 
Change the number of words being output at once.
Advanced Configurations: Change based on sentence lengths (8 words: 2,3,3 | 3,3,2 | ...). Change color of text depending on word type | Sentence type (Questions could be in green, shouts in red; Could also make associations with who is speaking).
Pause it. 
Use keyboard shortcuts (p|P --> pause, right_arrow --> speedup, left_arrow ->speeddown).
